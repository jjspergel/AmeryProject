Julian Spergel's repository for RCES final project on the climate of the Amery Ice Shelf


Research Question: Are the sizes of the meltwater lakes that form seasonally on the Amery Ice Shelf controlled more by local air temperature or by shortwave radiation, as measured by clear-sky vs. cloudy sky conditions?

Data:
1. AVHRR Cloud Properties-PATMOS-X: Daily cloud fraction (1979-2018). Format: Daily NetCDF file
Link: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/avhrr-reflectance-cloud-properties-patmos-extended/access/
2. Automatic Weather station data from Amery G3 (70°53'31''S,	69°52'21''E): Hourly average air temperature, wind, and humidity data (1999-2018). Format: NetCDF file
Link:http://aws.acecrc.org.au/data/AmeryG3_antarctic_aws_1999_2017.nc
3. Mapped seasonal lake surface area from 1974-2018: I used remotely-sensed images to map the extents of supraglacial lakes on the Amery Ice Shelf. Format: ShapeFile

Summary of Analysis:

1. I will calculate a climatology for the Amery Ice Shelf, calculating average seasonal temperatures and anomalies, and average seasonal cloud fraction and anomalies. 
2. The peak annual surface area of the supraglacial lakes will be correlated to the averages of austal summer cloud fraction data and austral summer temperature data.

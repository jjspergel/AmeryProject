# AmeryProject
Julian Spergel's repository for RCES final project on the climate of the Amery Ice Shelf


Research Question: Are the sizes of the meltwater lakes that form seasonally on the Amery Ice Shelf controlled more by local air temperature or by shortwave radiation, as measured by clear-sky vs. cloudy sky conditions?

4. Mapped seasonal lake surface area from 1974-2018: I used remotely-sensed images to map the extents of supraglacial lakes on the Amery Ice Shelf. Format: ShapeFile

Summary of Analysis:

1. I will calculate a climatology for the Amery Ice Shelf, calculating average seasonal temperatures and anomalies, and average seasonal cloud fraction and anomalies. 
2. The peak annual surface area of the supraglacial lakes will be correlated to the averages of austal summer cloud fraction data, austral summer temperature data, and average calculated sensible heat (wind and temperature-based bulk heat transfer).
3. I have zoned the lakes on the Amery Ice Shelf into several "basins" based on observed stream networks during two decades, and I would like to calculate the sensitivity to each individual basin to changes in temperature and in cloud cover.
